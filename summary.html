<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Initial exploratory analysis showed that proportions of respondents to each question
are reasonably in line with expected population proportions. For example, we would
expect that 89% of Canadians have a High School diploma or equivalent, with about
57% also having some form of post secondary certification.  The actual values show
approximately 60% of respondents have a post secondary certification, with an additional
25% having high school equivalent, and about 15% with no certification.</p>

<h2>The Data</h2>

<p>This data is collected from the Canadian Social Survey, with data from 2022,
2023, and 2024. Data for institutional confidence was collected twice per year
for each of these years.</p>

<p>The CSS is intended to provide information to the government on developing
social issues in Canada. The survey is limited to the 10 provinces, and to
persons not living on a reserve.  Non-institutionalized persons, age 15 or older
are eligible, but the survey is available only in English and French.</p>

<p>The variables examined here are a small subset of all data collected in the
CSS. The Confidence indicators were not included in all iterations of the CSS,
which is administered quarterly.</p>
